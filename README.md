# R
## <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminSivac/Projects_2022/blob/main/GoogleDataAnalytics/Cyclistic.md">Google Data Analytics - Cyclistic</a>
My first take on a data analytics project where I profile users and share insights on how to improve marketing. 

## <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminSivac/Projects_2022/blob/main/Multivariate_Methods/Multivariate_methods.md">Multivariate Methods</a>
I got tired of seeing basic, descriptive statistics while browsing for project inspirations, and so I reimagined and improved upon an old assignment I did last year. It mainly covers machine learning methods, probability, and hypothesis testing. 

## <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminSivac/Projects_2022/tree/main/DataCamp">DataCamp</a>
I decided to try out a few Datacamp courses in R, and possibly SQL, which has so far been a good learning experience and I get access to a few projects/datasets that I'm going to try out. Nothing too fancy, but they are short and sweat which is a nice change of pace compared to my previous ones and my ongoing projects.

# SQL
## <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminSivac/Projects_2022/tree/main/DataWithDanny">Data With Danny</a>
I'm working my way through various SQL casestudies that are part of a 8 week long challenge. The casestudies ranges from health, marketing and people analytics to financial markets, consumer goods and digital marketing. It has so far been a great opportunity to reiterate basics, hone and utilise interesting concepts like recursive CTEs, cumulative aggregates, and indexing.
