I'm working my way through various SQL casestudies that are part of a 8 week long challenge. The casestudies ranges from health, marketing and people analytics to financial markets, consumer goods and digital marketing. It has so far been a great opportunity to reiterate basics, hone and utilise interesting concepts like recursive CTEs, cumulative aggregates, and indexing.
