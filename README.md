# Projects_2022

I'm excited to fill up my first ever github repository üòÅ

I will take on various projects to prepare myself for a career in data analysis, and by doing so learn:

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Cleaning
* Data Wrangling
* Statistical applications
* Analysis 
* Data Visualization

# R

My first take on a data analytics project where I profile users and share insights on how to improve marketing.

I got tired of seeing basic, descriptive statistics while browsing for project inspirations, and so I reimagined and improved upon an old assignment I did last year. It mainly covers two machine learning methods.

I decided to try out a few Datacamp courses in R, and possibly SQL, which has so far been a good learning experience. I also get access to a few projects/datasets that I'm going to try out, nothing too fancy, but they are short and sweat which is a nice change of pace compared to my previous ones.

# SQL
## <a href="https://github.com/BenjaminSivac/Projects_2022/tree/main/DataWithDanny">Data With Danny</a>
This 8 week long challenge filled with difficult SQL casestudies has been time well spent! It covered various domains ranging from health, marketing and people analytics to financial markets, consumer goods and digital marketing. It consisted of data cleaning, data exploration, and sales-, product-, segment analysis and much much more. It has been a great opportunity to reiterate basics and test interesting concepts like recursive CTEs, running total and cumulative frequency, lag() and lead() etc. There are still some unfinished solutions left to do which I'll get to in due time.

While I was first surprised that Datacamp had courses and projects for SQL, I ended up finding them quite shallow and unintersting. I'll upload the ones that I find worthwhile doing.

# Power BI
I decided to try out Power BI Desktop as I found it a lot more intuitive and less frustrating to work with than Tableau Public, but it also integrates really well with SQL Server. The plan is to visualize a few datasets that I've worked with before and learn DAX syntax.
