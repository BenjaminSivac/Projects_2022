### Introduction

Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that
there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new
streaming service that only had food related content - something like
Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in
2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their
customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from
around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure
all future investment decisions and new features were decided using
data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data
to answer important business questions.

### Available Data

Danny has shared the data design for Foodie-Fi and also short
descriptions on each of the database tables - our case study focuses on
only 2 tables but there will be a challenge to create a new table for
the Foodie-Fi team.

All datasets exist within the foodie\_fi database schema - be sure to
include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring
the data and answering the case study questions.

#### Table 1: plans

Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign
up.

Basic plan customers have limited access and can only stream their
videos and is only available monthly at $9.90

Pro plan customers have no watch time limits and are able to download
videos for offline viewing. Pro plans start at $19.90 a month or $199
for an annual subscription.

Customers can sign up to an initial 7 day free trial will automatically
continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel,
downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during
the trial.

When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn
plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end
of the billing period.

<div class="knitsql-table">

| plan\_id | plan\_name    | price |
|:---------|:--------------|------:|
| 0        | trial         |   0.0 |
| 1        | basic monthly |   9.9 |
| 2        | pro monthly   |  19.9 |
| 3        | pro annual    | 199.0 |
| 4        | churn         |    NA |

5 records

</div>

#### Table 2: subscriptions

Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific plan\_id
starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription -
the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the
start\_date in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the
actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or
annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straightaway.

When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of
their current billing period but the start\_date will be technically the
day they decided to cancel their service.

### Case Study Questions

This case study is split into an initial data understanding question
before diving straight into data analysis questions before finishing
with 1 single extension challenge.

#### A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the
subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s
onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort
of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

<div class="knitsql-table">

| customer\_id | plan\_name    | price | start\_date |
|-------------:|:--------------|------:|:------------|
|            1 | trial         |   0.0 | 2020-08-01  |
|            1 | basic monthly |   9.9 | 2020-08-08  |

2 records

</div>

**Customer id 1** started trial on 1st of August 2020 and afterwards paid
for a basic monthly subscription on August the 8th 2020.

Customer id 11 started trial on 19th of november 2020 and let it run out
with no renewal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="knitsql-table">

A simple but tedious solution to hardcode each bin. Could also do it in
a long format with 3 columns but it requires an additional CTE:

``` sql

        DISTINCT customer_id,
        start_date AS annual_date
    FROM
        subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id=3
),

cte_count_days AS(
    SELECT
        DATEDIFF(DAY, join_date, annual_date) AS days_to_upgrade
    FROM cte_join_day t
